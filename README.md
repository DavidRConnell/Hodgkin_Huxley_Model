# Hodgkin_Huxley_Model

MATLAB project I did for a numerical methods course fall 2016. Solves Hodgkin Huxley neuron models for a variety of outputs. These include: 
  * A plot of membrane potential, cross-membrane ion currents, Na^+ and K^+ activation and inactivation constants, and cunductances.
  * Comparison of ODE solving methods.
  * Membrane potential phase diagrams.
  * Comparing sub and supra threshold potentials and showing the affects of summation.
  * Showing changes caused by varying time constants for the Na^+ and K^+ activation constants.
  * A running plot of a self-propitiating multi-neuron system started with an intial current to one of the neurons.
    * Provides random connections with various connection strengths between neurons.
    * Different time constants for each neuron.
    * A plot of the first 5 neurons' membrane potentials over time and a stem plot for all of the neurons' membrane potentials.
